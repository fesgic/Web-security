Lab #4: CSRF where token is not tied to user session

vulnerable parameter - email change functionality

creds: weiner:peter

Analysis:
- relevant action: email change
- cookie, csrf based authentication
- csrf not tied to user session

POC
- lab4.html or
- login as user one
- capture change-email request and copy csrf token
- drop request
- login as user 2
- capture change-email request and replace csrf token with one we copied
- engagement tool -> generate csrf form
- option -> autosubmit; Regenerate
- host poc, send webpage link containing the poc to victim
- email changes as our csrf token is still valid and thus dont need to know victim's csrf token
- if user logged in, exploit works. if not doesn't work
