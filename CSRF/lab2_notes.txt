vulnerable parameter - email change functionality

csrf token with POST method not vulnerable

creds: weiner:peter

Analysis:
- relevant action: email change
- cookie based session authentication
- authentication only works with POST method

POC
- lab2.html or:
- engagement tool -> generate csrf form
- option -> autosubmit; Regenerate
- change method to GET
- host poc, send webpage link containing the poc to victim

- if user logged in, exploit works. if not doesn't work
