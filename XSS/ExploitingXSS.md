## ExploitingXSS
1. Exploiting XSS to steal cookies
- Most web applications use cookies for session handling
- You can exploit xss to send the victims cookies to your own domain, then manually inject the cookies into the browser and impersonate them.
----- limitations include --------
- victim may not be logged in
- many apps hide cookies from js using the HttpOnly flag
- sessions might be locked to additional factors such as IP address
- session might time out before hijacking it
2. Capturing passwords
- many users have password managers that autofill their passwords.
- take advantage by creating a password input, reading autofilled password and sending it to your own domain
- only works on users who have password managers that perfom an autofill.
3. Exploting xss to perform csrf
- anything a legimated user can do, can prolly be done using xss.
- a CSRF can also occur as a standalone vulnerability.
- When CSRF occurs as a standalone vulnerability, it can be patched using strategies like anti-CSRF tokens. However, these strategies do not provide any protection if an XSS vulnerability is also present.

## Find and test for stored XSS
- Test all relevant endpoints .e.eg.
1. parameters or other data within the url query string and message body
2. url file path
3. http requests headers that may not be exploitable in relation to reflected xss
4. any out-of band routes which an attacker may deliver data into an application
- The exit points for stored XSS attacks are all possible HTTP responses that are returned to any kind of application user in any situation.
